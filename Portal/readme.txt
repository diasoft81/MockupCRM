Considerations
Key Management: Securely store encryption keys. Use SecureStorage (or similar) in production.
Performance: WebAssembly may have performance limitations compared to server-side encryption.
Security: Avoid exposing private keys or sensitive data in the client-side code.

In production, do not hardcode the key into your application. Instead, retrieve it securely using:

Environment Variables
Secure APIs (e.g., a Key Vault like Azure Key Vault)
User Authentication/Authorization for controlled access to keys

Testing and Deployment
Test Locally: Ensure data encrypts and decrypts correctly.
Deployment: Use HTTPS and consider integrating Web Crypto API for additional browser-native cryptography if needed.
